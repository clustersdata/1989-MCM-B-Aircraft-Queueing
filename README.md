# 1989-MCM-B-Aircraft-Queueing


A common procedure at airports is to assign aircraft (A/C) to runways on a first-come-first-served basis. That is, as soon as an A/C is ready to leave the gate (“push-back”), the pilot calls ground control and is added to the queue. Suppose that a control tower has access to a fast online database with the following information for each A/C:

    the time it is scheduled for pushback;
    the time it actually pushes back; the number of passengers who are scheduled to make a connection at the next stop, as well as the time to make that connection; and
    the schedule time of arrival at its next stop Assume that there are seven types of A/C with passenger capacities varying from 100 to 400 in steps of 50. Develop and analyze a mathematical model that takes into account both the travelers' and airlines' satisfaction.
